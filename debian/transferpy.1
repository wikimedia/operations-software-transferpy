transfer is a Python 3 framework intended to move large files or directory
trees between WMF production hosts in an efficient way.
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
source
Fully qualified domain of the host where the files to
be copied are currently located, the symbol ':', and a
file or directory path of such files (e.g.
sourcehost.wm.org:/srv ). There can be only one source
host and path.
.TP
target
Fully qualified domain of the hosts (separated by
spaces) where the files to be copied, each one with
its destination absolute path directory, separated by
\&':'.There must be at least one target. If more than
one target is defined, it will be copied to all of
them. The target path MUST be a directory.
.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-config\fR CONFIG_FILE
Configuration file path. If found, it will set as the
execution defaults unless overridden on the command
line. Default: \fI\,/etc/transferpy/transferpy.conf\/\fP
.TP
\fB\-\-port\fR PORT
Port used for netcat listening on the receiver
machine. By default, transfer selects a free port
available in the receiver machine from the range 4400
to 4500
.TP
\fB\-\-type\fR {file,xtrabackup,decompress}
file: regular file or directory recursive copy (Default)
xtrabackup: runs mariabackup on source
decompress: a tarball is transmitted as is and decompressed on target
.TP
\fB\-\-compress\fR
Use pigz to compress stream using gzip format (ignored
on decompress mode) (Default)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-compress\fR
Do not use compression on streaming
.TP
\fB\-\-encrypt\fR
Enable compression \- send data using openssl and
algorithm chacha20 (Default)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-encrypt\fR
Disable compression \- send data using an unencrypted
stream
.TP
\fB\-\-checksum\fR
Generate a checksum of files before transmission which
will be used for checking integrity after transfer
finishes. (This only works for file transfers)
(Default)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-checksum\fR
Disable checksums
.TP
\fB\-\-parallel\-checksum\fR
Generate checksum parallel to the transmission for
data integrity check (ignored if \fB\-\-checksum\fR is
enabled). \fB\-\-parallel_checksum\fR is faster than
\fB\-\-checksum\fR but less reliable
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-parallel\-checksum\fR
Disable parallel checksum (Default)
.TP
\fB\-\-stop\-slave\fR
Only relevant if on xtrabackup mode: attempt to stop
slave on the mysql instance before running xtrabackup,
and start slave after it completes to try to speed up
backup by preventing many changes queued on the
xtrabackup_log. By default, it doesn't try to stop
replication.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
Outputs relevant information about transfer +
information about Cuminexecution. By default, the
output contains only relevant information about the
transfer.
